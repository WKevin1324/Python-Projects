'''Variables Code Challenge'''

# ask a user to enter their first name and store it in a variable
firstname = input("Enter first name: ")
# ask a user to enter their last name and store it in a variable
lastname = input("Enter last name: ")
# print their full name
# Make sure you have a space between first and last name
# Make sure the first letter of first name and last name is uppercase
# Make sure the rest of the name is lowercase
print(firstname.capitalize() + " " + lastname.capitalize())

# Ask a user to enter a number
num1 = input("Enter a number: ")
# Ask a user to enter a second number
num2 = input("Enter another number: ")
# Calculate the total of the two numbers added together
# Print 'first number + second number = answer'
# For example if someone enters 4 and 6 the output should read
# 4 + 6 = 10
ans1 = int(num1) + int(num2)
print(str(num1) + " + " + str(num2) + " = " + str(ans1))
# Continue these steps for subtraction, multiplication, and division
ans2 = int(num1) - int(num2)
print(str(num1) + " - " + str(num2) + " = " + str(ans2))
ans3 = int(num1) * int(num2)
print(str(num1) + " * " + str(num2) + " = " + str(ans3))
ans4 = int(num1) / int(num2)
print(str(num1) + " / " + str(num2) + " = " + str(ans4))
